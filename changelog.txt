= 2.0.0 =

**Release Date: September 1, 2024**

* Major: Refactored admin functionality into class
* Feature: Added `number_controller` form tag; use the number text input/spinbox as a controller.
* Feature: Added `range_controller` form tag; use the numeric slider as a controller.
* Feature: Updated controlled items to allow multiple controllers for `OR` statements. Use the pipe (`|`) character to separate controllers. If an element has multiple controllers, then there should be a `data-{controller ID}-values` attribute that sets the values for that specific controller instead of the generic `data-values` attribute.
* Feature: Updated controlled items to allow for numerical comparison operations. Prefix a number with two dashes to perform less than or equal to comparisons (e.g. `--100`). Suffix a number with two dashes to perform greater than or equal to comparisons (e.g. `5--`). Use a single dash between two numbers to perform an inclusive BETWEEN comparison (e.g. `5-100`).
* Feature: Set the controller's value to `BLANK` or `EMPTY` to match only blank or empty values.
* Feature: Set the controller's value to `*` to match any truthy value.
* Feature: Set the controller's value to `EMPTY_OR_ZERO` or `FALSEY` to match any falsey value.
* Feature: Prefix a controlled element's value with `!=` to match everything except that value.

= 1.1.0 =

**Release Date: April 15, 2024**

* Feature: Number fields can now be controllers. They display controlled fields based on number ranges set in the controlled element's values.
* Feature: Controlled fields can now have multiple controllers. The `data-controller` value should be a pipe-delimited list of controller IDs. If it has multiple controllers, then there should be a `data-{controller ID}-values` attribute that sets the values for that specific controller. Controlled fields with multiple controllers are only hidden if all controllers evaluate to no matches. Otherwise, it will remain visible. Multiple controllers are treated as an OR comparison, meaning at least one controller must be active for the controlled field to display. Nest them to treat them as an AND operation.
* Feature: Values can include operations such as `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=`, `*`, `BLANK`, `EMPTY_OR_ZERO`. The operation `=` is assumed when no comparison is found.
* Fix: added `!important` to `au-cf7-controller` CSS to ensure it's hidden in case of conflicting styles.
